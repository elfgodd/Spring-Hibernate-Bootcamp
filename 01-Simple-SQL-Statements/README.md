## Section 1: Simple - But Powerful - SQL Statements

### 1. Links

List of largest cities:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities

PH SQL:  
Tool to get a free Postgres database + run some queries  
https://pg-sql.com/

### 2. Analyzing CREATE TABLE

Keyword: CREATE TABLE
keywords: Tell the database that we want to do something.
Always written out in capital letters

Identifier: cities
Identifiers: Tell the database what thing we want to act on.
Always written out in lowercase letters

```
CREATE TABLE cities (
  name VARCHAR(50),
  country VARCHAR(50),
  population INTEGER,
  area INTEGER
);
```

VARCHAR(50) -> Column Data Types:  
Variable length character. Text! if we put in a string longer
than 50 characters, we'll get an error

INTEGER -> Column Data Types:
Number without a decimal. -2,147,483,647 to +2,147,483,647.
Anything larger or smaller = error!

### 3. Inserting Data Into a Table

```
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES ('Tokyo', 'Japan', 38505000,8223)
```

```
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES
	('Delhi', 'India', 28125000,2240),
  ('Shanghai', 'China', 2212500, 4015),
  ('Sao Paulo', 'Brazil', 20935000, 3043);
```

This query , gets all columns from cities table

```
SELECT * FROM cities;
```

This query , gets the name and country columns from cities table

```
SELECT name, country FROM cities;
```

### 4. Coding Exercise 1: Create, Insert, and Select!

```
CREATE TABLE movies (
    title VARCHAR(60),
    box_office INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO movies (title, box_office)
VALUES
    ('The Avengers', 1500000000),
    ('Batman v Superman', 873000000);


-- WRITE YOUR SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE!
SELECT title, box_office from MOVIES
```

### 5. Calculated Columns

Calculated column with math operations:  
`SELECT name, population / area FROM cities;`

```
| +  |  Add   | ^  |  Exponent    |
|----|--------|----|--------------|
| -  |Subtract| |/ |Square Root   |
| *  |Multiply|  @ |Absolute Value|
| /  |Divide  |  % |Remainder     |
```

### 6. Coding Exercise 2: Using Calculated Columns

Renaming a calculated column:  
SELECT name, population / area AS population_density
FROM cities;

Using Calculated Columns  
Take a look at the following table called phones. This table has already been inserted into the database for you.

Write a query that will select the name of each phone and calculate the total revenue for each phone (price X units_sold)

Rename this calculated column to revenue

`SELECT name, price * units_sold AS revenue FROM phones;`

### 5. String Operators and Functions

```
|    ||   -->|Join two strings                      |
| CONCAT()-->|Join two strings                      |
| LOWER() -->|Gives a lower case string             |
| LENGTH()-->|gives number of characters in a string|
| UPPER() -->|Square Root                           |
```

`SELECT name || country FROM cities;`
